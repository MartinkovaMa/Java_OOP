## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

Create a `Product` class, add attribute `name` to it. 

Add the methods `setName` (for setting `name`) and `getName` (for returning `name`).



## Exercise 2

Create a `Person` class, add the following attributes to it:

- name,
- surname,
- age,
- gender

All attributes must be private and have default values set.

Add methods:  
- `setName`,
- `setSurname`,
- `setAge`,
- `setGender`,  

which will set class attributes according to the name they indicate.
For example: `setName` â€“ sets the `name` attribute.

In the `Main02.java` file, in the `main` method place code that creates an object of the `Person` class, named `person`, and then sets all class attributes using the previously created methods.



## Exercise 3

Add a `getFullName` method to the `Person` class, which will return the name and surname joined by a space character.



## Exercise 4

In the `Person` class, write a method named `increaseAge` which increments the `age` variable by 1.



## Exercise 5

Create a `Car` class with the following attributes:

- brand
- model
- price

Create access methods to the above attributes, the so-called getters and setters.

Add a `toString` method that will display the brand and price in one line.
